DOCUMENTATION FOR ASSIGNMENT 1

- Project Name: "To See This Beautiful World"- creating a website to showcase the 30MFF


- Project Description: This project is to present our short video in 30MFF on a website. The overarching idea I want to express through the website is to let people observe the word and possibly document them in multiple ways. I want the users to feel appeased, quite, and aesthetic while viewing this website. Later I will keep on polishing it and add other of my works that document the life to the website.
                 

- Process: I used a relatively minimalistic approach to minimize visual distractions. I also use big areas of grey white and black to create a sense of tranquility. The interaction is also minimal but I hope the navigation is clear enough. I use images in black and white as backgrounds. These images function as an invitation of a closer look at the details in life because these images are all cropped from larger pictures.

- Reflection/Evaluation: To me, I struggled a lot during the process, I found it difficult to adjust the positions of the elements. Also, although the online tutorials are helpful,I still find my outcome to be different. I guess it is probably because I used an image as the background. Overall, I think I achieved 80% of the aesthetics I expected but only 60% of the functions that I wanted to implement. I cut the part of javascript from my original version (on the hamburger icon) to avoid redundant navigation and add one javascript that can help change the color of the text while scrolling. I still need to watch more tutorials to achieve what I wanted to achieve.


DOCUMENTATION FOR ASSIGNMENT 2

- Project Name: "The Journey of A Water Droplet"


- Project Description: The aim of this project was to produce a comic that would convey the story of water and highlight the ongoing impact of water pollution.We wanted to raise awareness about the ongoing and perennial deterioration of our water resources. Due to its unsustainable use, water bodies have diminished, making water polluted, and freshwater scarce.We also believed it was important to sow the ideas of water conservation in young minds and thus we meant our comic as a children’s comic for easier understanding and to be able to reach a wider audience. We made the water droplet a character and gave it a voice and emotions. This would add to the emotional appeal it would create on younger minds. Our goal was to create an experience that was interactive but also easy to follow and grasp. This would allow us to effectively convey our message to our target audience. 
 
 
 
- Process: We had an initial meeting and discussed topics we felt passionate about, then we came up with a common topic of water conservation. After that we discussed aspects that we felt comfortable about and thus divided the graphics and coding work accordingly. Before going into the actual work, we looked at various comic examples and read through Mccloud for inspiration. Then we set the water droplet as a character and gave it its own voice. We employ a chronological temporal approach to signify that water used by the dinosaurs is the same as the water we use today.To accentuate that concept, we set the position of the droplet as constant on the screen. The expression and colour of the droplet changes as you move ahead in time to highlight the deteriorating health of our current water supplies. We also enable readers to click the image to trigger a new image, and repeated clicking converts into an action to add interactivity to the website. Also clicking the droplet gives a new dialogue each time.
 
 
 
- Reflection/Evaluation: Our expectations of having a simplistic theme and feeling was met through the animation and easy navigation of our website. The theme is also conveyed with the text in simple English, especially those in the speech bubbles. We also successfully informed the user about the misuse of water and ways to improve, which raise awareness and foster understanding of the issue of water conservation. As the challenge for us initially was interactivity on the website, we did meet our expectations as our final product includes interactivity from clicking to move forward in dialogue and action. We aimed to make the comic highly interactive and tried to achieve as much as we could based on our limited knowledge of Javascript. These interactions also incorporated the features of both comic and website as it requires user interaction through clicking while the graphics function as a comic. A possible improvement is a clearer way to invite the readers to both click on the droplet and the background image to see the interactivity of this project, as right now, it is possible to click on the transparent portion of the droplet’s image instead of the background. Even so, having explored several new concepts through the course of this comic, we feel it was a great learning experience to grow as front-end developers and sharpen our skills in drawing and animation.
