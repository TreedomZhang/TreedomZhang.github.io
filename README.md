DOCUMENTATION

- Project Name: "To See This Beautiful World"- creating a website to showcase the 30MFF


- Project Description: This project is to present our short video in 30MFF on a website. The overarching idea I want to express through the website is to let people observe the word and possibly document them in multiple ways. I want the users to feel appeased, quite, and aesthetic while viewing this website. Later I will keep on polishing it and add other of my works that document the life to the website.
                 

- Process: I used a relatively minimalistic approach to minimize visual distractions. I also use big areas of grey white and black to create a sense of tranquility. The interaction is also minimal but I hope the navigation is clear enough. I use images in black and white as backgrounds. These images function as an invitation of a closer look at the details in life because these images are all cropped from larger pictures.

- Reflection/Evaluation: To me, I struggled a lot during the process, I found it difficult to adjust the positions of the elements. Also, although the online tutorials are helpful,I still find my outcome to be different. I guess it is probably because I used an image as the background. Overall, I think I achieved 80% of the aesthetics I expected but only 60% of the functions that I wanted to implement. I cut the part of javascript from my original version (on the hamburger icon) to avoid redundant navigation. I still need to watch more tutorials to achieve that.
